It is possible to create a company that acts as a custodial Ethereum wallet provider and issues IBAN accounts to clients. However, it is important to note that such a company would likely require regulatory approval and licenses to operate as a financial institution.

From a technical standpoint, the following elements would be involved in creating such a platform:

Custodial Wallet: The company would need to develop a secure custodial wallet to store and manage user's crypto assets, including ETH and ERC-20 tokens.

IBAN Account Issuance: The company would need to develop a system to issue IBAN accounts to its clients. This would involve partnering with a bank or financial institution that is authorized to issue IBAN accounts.

NFT Issuance: The company would need to develop a system to issue NFTs associated with specific IBAN accounts. The NFTs would need to be designed such that they can be transferable, but the IBAN associated with each NFT remains the same.

Fiat and Crypto Reserves: The company would need to maintain reserves in both fiat and crypto to facilitate the automatic translation of funds between IBAN accounts and crypto assets.

KYC and AML Compliance: The company would need to develop and implement robust Know-Your-Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures to comply with regulatory requirements.

Platform Interface: The company would need to develop a user-friendly platform interface that allows users to manage their IBAN accounts and associated NFTs, as well as buy, sell, and transfer their crypto assets.

Regulatory Compliance: Depending on the jurisdiction in which the company operates, it may need to obtain regulatory approval and licenses to operate as a financial institution.
